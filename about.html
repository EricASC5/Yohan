           <h2>Why are we here? Why did we build Yohan.Redux?</h2>
           <p>Yohan.Redux is the precursor to Yohan, the passion project I’m currently scripting at the moment. Yohan.Redux serves as a proof of  concept to both this lovely crowd and myself that  with time and effort a game on the scale of my dreams is within my reach. It also serves as the first fully functioning advertisement run of Yohan as a brand. With my partner’s fantastic work developing a this website, the rough draft of the aesthetics the game wants to display is fully realized.</p>
